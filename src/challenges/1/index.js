/*
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index),
which is calculated using the formula:
    BMI = mass / height^2
        = mass / (height * height)
    (mass in kg and height in meter).

1.  Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2.  Calculate both their BMIs
3.  Create a boolean variable containing information about whether
    Mark has a higher BMI than John.
4.  Print a string to the console containing the variable from step 3.
    (Something like "Is Mark's BMI higher than John's? true").

GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
